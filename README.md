# Responsive Artist Page

# Description

- This project is a simple responsive artist page showcasing two famous artists: Camila Cabello and The Weeknd. The layout is designed using CSS Flexbox and Grid to ensure an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface across different screen sizes.

# Layout Approach

- Flexbox for Header & Navigation: The header uses Flexbox to align the title and navigation links.

- Grid & Flexbox for Articles:

- The article sections use Flexbox for aligning images and text side by side.

- The overall page structure is centered with max-width constraints for better readability.

# Responsive Design Techniques

- Media Queries are used to adjust the layout for smaller screens:

- On screens below 768px, the navigation menu and article layout shift from row-based to column-based, ensuring better readability on mobile.

- The images resize dynamically to fit within the available space without distortion.
